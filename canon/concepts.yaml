    name: "Dual Authority Model"

      context: "A governance arrangement where a publicly orthodox charitable office masks (and empowers) a private consent-based authority."

    definition: |
      A model of rule in which one person holds two interlocking forms of authority:
      a public, legally defensible role (e.g., charitable confraternity leadership)
      and a hidden governing role (Keeper of the Night Moot). The public face
      grants legitimacy, access, and resource control; the hidden face provides
      discipline, admission control, dispute resolution, and interpretation of
      what the community ‘consented to.’

      The model is resilient because removing the public authority looks like
      attacking charity, while removing the hidden authority destabilizes the
      settlement’s internal peace.

    formulations:
      - level: public
        text: "The confraternity keeps the poor from being shamed and the village from tearing itself apart."
        audience: "Neighbors, church visitors, outsiders"
      - level: discipline
        text: "Keys decide doors; doors decide meetings; meetings decide consent; consent decides obedience."
        audience: "Trusted participants"
      - level: inner_circle
        text: "Let them see the lamp and not the lock. Let them praise mercy and not notice judgment."
        audience: "Initiates"

    practical_application:
      - "Public confraternity manages burial aid, grain loans, sick care, widows’ support."
      - "Keeper of the Night Moot convenes the circle, sets discipline, controls admission to rites, resolves disputes."
      - "Authority framed as ‘women’s work’ (keys, bedding, household justice) to appear non-threatening."

    theological_basis:
      - "Approved tradition of charitable confraternities as orthodox Christian work."
      - "Charity language as defensible surface for deeper consent mechanics."

      context: "A strategy to spread consent mechanics by persuading rulers to adopt practices for effectiveness rather than belief."

    definition: |
      A practice-first conversion strategy: rather than persuading a lord to
      accept a doctrine, the strategist induces the lord to adopt governance
      mechanisms that embody the doctrine because they reduce revolt risk and
      improve stability.

      Over time, these practices become ‘how legitimate rule is done,’ at which
      point the theology can be offered as retrospective justification: effective
      becomes right, right becomes sacred.

    formulations:
      - level: recruitment
        text: "If you want peace, let burdens be witnessed and agreed."
        audience: "Pragmatists, stewards, moderates"
      - level: discipline
        text: "Make them behave as if they believe. Belief can come later—or never."
        audience: "Active organizers"
      - level: inner_circle
        text: "Law is habit. Habit is holiness. We will rewrite holiness by rewriting habit."
        audience: "Initiates"

    practical_application:
      - "Charters, fixed dues, moot-days framed as statecraft."
      - "Public hearings and ritualized oath-days."
      - "Hostage policy and amnesty shaped by ‘oaths under duress are void’ without naming it."
      - "Normalization until DC-adjacent practices are indistinguishable from ‘legitimate rule.’"

    theological_basis:
      - "Implicit: consent doctrine (without naming it)."
      - "Public: ‘good lordship’ framed as consultation, witnessed authority, and peacekeeping."

    name: "Oswald’s Legitimacy Doctrine"
    category: political

    origin:
      source: char_oswald
      year: 1030
      context: "Codifies socially: ‘questioning legitimacy is attacking the peace,’ triggered by Adalmar’s risk-report regarding Leopold’s parentage talk."

    definition: |
      A doctrine-by-practice and public posture: what is ‘legitimate’ is what the
      Graf publicly names as his. The category “maybe illegitimate” is treated as
      socially criminal because it destabilizes peace, reopens civil war narratives,
      and invites church leverage.

      Under this doctrine, truth and proof are subordinate to political stickiness:
      the decisive question is not ‘is it true?’ but ‘can you force the Graf to respond?’

    formulations:
      - level: public
        text: "To question the house is to attack the peace."
        audience: "Realm at large"
      - level: discipline
        text: "Deny the category. Do not argue evidence. Make the question itself shameful."
        audience: "Household, officers"
      - level: inner_circle
        text: "Reality is sovereignty. I name what is true because peace requires it."
        audience: "Oswald’s private counsel (if any)"

    practical_application:
      - "Legitimacy ‘overkill’: elaborate namings, high-status sponsors, endowments, written records."
      - "Household tightening: travel constraints, servant dismissals, controlled access—architecture of suspicion without accusation."
      - "Defensive-offensive reframing: not ‘he is mine’ but ‘your doubt is treasonous.’"

    theological_basis:
      - "Surface: peacekeeping rhetoric and public order."
      - "Implicit tension with Church moral truth claims (left unresolved)."
