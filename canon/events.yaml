    summary:
      public: |
        Nothing official. If questioned, household men deny any rumor and treat the subject as insolence.
        In common talk, “there was no talk”—only a sudden tightening of tongues.
      actual: |
        Leopold’s birth (March 1030) creates a predictable vulnerability: servants, travelers, and scribes
        accumulate “small certainties” about timing, absence, and proximity. Brother Adalmar leverages his
        access to household schedules and road-chatter to predict how rumor could form.

        Adalmar approaches Oswald privately and frames the matter as risk management rather than accusation:
        “There will be talk.” “If it spreads, enemies will weaponize it.” “Here are the weak points in the story.”

        Oswald’s response is not evidentiary. It is sovereign: “There will be no talk.”
        He does not rebut; he abolishes the premise socially.
      hidden: |
        The meaning of “no talk” is operational as well as rhetorical: the household’s social reality is
        enforced until “maybe” cannot safely be spoken. The first punishments (if any) are made exemplary
        enough to teach the rule without leaving a clean legal record.

        Adalmar understands he has crossed from useful clerkship into existential legitimacy-work.
        Whether Oswald marks him as indispensable, dangerous, or both is not openly visible afterward.

    participants:
      - character: char_oswald
        role: "Lord of the household; final arbiter of legitimacy in practice"
        outcome: "Issues an absolute social prohibition: rumor itself becomes punishable"
        knowledge: "Treats legitimacy as an enforced condition, not a debated fact"

      - character: char_adalmar
        role: "Risk messenger; scribe with access to household timing and travel chatter"
        outcome: "Successfully places the threat on Oswald’s desk; also exposes his own awareness"
        knowledge: "Knows which ‘weak points’ would generate rumor; presents them as a containment problem"

      - character: char_leopold
        role: "Infant; catalytic precondition for rumor formation"
        outcome: "Becomes a latent legitimacy vulnerability (publicly denied as such)"
        knowledge: "N/A"

      - character: char_sibilla
        role: "Not accused in the approach; implicated only as a possible axis of rumor in others’ mouths"
        outcome: "Protected publicly by refusal to permit the category of doubt"
        knowledge: "Unknown whether she is aware of Adalmar’s approach or Oswald’s inner reasoning"

      - character: char_otto
        role: "Heir-line proximity; the threatened beneficiary of ‘no maybe’"
        outcome: "Legitimacy insulated by making ‘maybe illegitimate’ socially impossible"
        knowledge: "N/A"

    organizations: []

    consequences:
      immediate:
        - "Household speech tightens: questions about timing, absence, and ‘who was where’ become taboo"
        - "Rumor is reframed as hostility; social penalties replace debate"
        - "Adalmar becomes newly legible to Oswald as a legitimacy operator (asset and/or risk)"
      long_term:
        - "Oswald’s regime establishes a pattern: contested legitimacy is not argued; it is criminalized"
        - "Church leverage is blunted in the short term by the absence of an admissible rumor-channel"
        - "Future oaths/charters gain ‘sovereign certainty’ at the cost of brittle repression"
      unintended:
        - "Suppressed talk concentrates into private confessional channels and enemy intelligence networks"
        - "Any later breach (proof, scandal, witness) hits harder because ‘maybe’ had no tolerated outlet"
        - "Those who enforce the silence accrue quiet power (and quiet guilt)"

    question: "How did Oswald operationalize ‘There will be no talk’ in the days/weeks after Adalmar’s warning?"

    last_confirmed:
      date: 1030
      event: evt_1030_spring_breach
      status: "Adalmar warned; Oswald issued the sovereign prohibition; aftermath method not fixed."

    options:
      - option: "Exemplary punishment with plausible deniability (a dismissal, a beating framed as ‘insolence’, a public penance)"
        likelihood: high
        implications:
          - "Silence spreads quickly without creating a clean legal paper trail"
          - "Household fear rises; loyalty becomes performative"
        dependencies:
          - "Who is chosen as the example (servant, guard, clerk, outsider)"

      - option: "Quiet containment (bribes, reassignment, escorting chatterers out, controlled narratives to key gossip nodes)"
        likelihood: medium
        implications:
          - "Less overt terror, more stable long-term governance"
          - "Requires competent managers and money"
        dependencies:
          - "Who runs Oswald’s household discipline and purse"

      - option: "Clerical channeling (confessors instructed to treat rumor as sin; spiritual threat substitutes for secular threat)"
        likelihood: medium
        implications:
          - "Shifts enforcement onto the Church’s moral machinery"
          - "Creates a future vulnerability if clergy turn hostile"
        dependencies:
          - "Which priests have access to the household and how cooperative they are"

      - option: "Counter-rumor offensive (‘enemies will say anything’) paired with selective intimidation"
        likelihood: low
        implications:
          - "Makes the topic speakable only as slander, not inquiry"
          - "Harder to sustain if evidence ever emerges"
        dependencies:
          - "Availability of scapegoats/enemies to blame"

    priority: high
    needs_decision_by: "Before any play or canon thread treats the household as either ‘tight-lipped’ or ‘leaky’ in 1030"
    notes: "This choice determines whether the Breach becomes a quiet administrative maneuver or the start of visible repression."
