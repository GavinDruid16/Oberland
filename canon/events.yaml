    summary:
      public: |
        Nothing official. If questioned, household men deny any rumor and treat the subject as insolence.
        In common talk, “there was no talk”—only a sudden tightening of tongues.
      actual: |
        Leopold’s birth (March 1030) creates a predictable vulnerability: servants, travelers, and scribes
        accumulate “small certainties” about timing, absence, and proximity. Brother Adalmar leverages his
        access to household schedules and road-chatter to predict how rumor could form.

        Adalmar approaches Oswald privately and frames the matter as risk management rather than accusation:
        “There will be talk.” “If it spreads, enemies will weaponize it.” “Here are the weak points in the story.”

        Oswald’s response is not evidentiary. It is sovereign: “There will be no talk.”
        He does not rebut; he abolishes the premise socially.
      hidden: |
        The meaning of “no talk” is operational as well as rhetorical: the household’s social reality is
        enforced until “maybe” cannot safely be spoken. The first punishments (if any) are made exemplary
        enough to teach the rule without leaving a clean legal record.

        Adalmar understands he has crossed from useful clerkship into existential legitimacy-work.
        Whether Oswald marks him as indispensable, dangerous, or both is not openly visible afterward.

    participants:
      - character: char_oswald
        role: "Lord of the household; final arbiter of legitimacy in practice"
        outcome: "Issues an absolute social prohibition: rumor itself becomes punishable"
        knowledge: "Treats legitimacy as an enforced condition, not a debated fact"

      - character: char_adalmar
        role: "Risk messenger; scribe with access to household timing and travel chatter"
        outcome: "Successfully places the threat on Oswald’s desk; also exposes his own awareness"
        knowledge: "Knows which ‘weak points’ would generate rumor; presents them as a containment problem"

      - character: char_leopold
        role: "Infant; catalytic precondition for rumor formation"
        outcome: "Becomes a latent legitimacy vulnerability (publicly denied as such)"

      - character: char_sibilla
        role: "Not accused in the approach; implicated only as a possible axis of rumor in others’ mouths"
        outcome: "Protected publicly by refusal to permit the category of doubt"
        knowledge: "Unknown whether she is aware of Adalmar’s approach or Oswald’s inner reasoning"

    organizations: []

    consequences:
      immediate:
        - "Household speech tightens: questions about timing, absence, and ‘who was where’ become taboo"
        - "Rumor is reframed as hostility; social penalties replace debate"
        - "Adalmar becomes newly legible to Oswald as a legitimacy operator (asset and/or risk)"
      long_term:
        - "Oswald’s regime establishes a pattern: contested legitimacy is not argued; it is criminalized"
        - "Church leverage is blunted in the short term by the absence of an admissible rumor-channel"
        - "Future oaths/charters gain ‘sovereign certainty’ at the cost of brittle repression"
      unintended:
        - "Suppressed talk concentrates into private confessional channels and enemy intelligence networks"
        - "Any later breach (proof, scandal, witness) hits harder because ‘maybe’ had no tolerated outlet"
        - "Those who enforce the silence accrue quiet power (and quiet guilt)"

    question: "How did Oswald operationalize ‘There will be no talk’ in the days/weeks after Adalmar’s warning?"

    last_confirmed:
      date: 1030
      event: evt_1030_spring_breach
      status: "Adalmar warned; Oswald issued the sovereign prohibition; aftermath method not fixed."

    options:
      - option: "Exemplary punishment with plausible deniability (a dismissal, a beating framed as ‘insolence’, a public penance)"
        likelihood: high
        implications:
          - "Silence spreads quickly without creating a clean legal paper trail"
          - "Household fear rises; loyalty becomes performative"
        dependencies:
          - "Who is chosen as the example (servant, guard, clerk, outsider)"

      - option: "Quiet containment (bribes, reassignment, escorting chatterers out, controlled narratives to key gossip nodes)"
        likelihood: medium
        implications:
          - "Less overt terror, more stable long-term governance"
          - "Requires competent managers and money"
        dependencies:
          - "Who runs Oswald’s household discipline and purse"

      - option: "Clerical channeling (confessors instructed to treat rumor as sin; spiritual threat substitutes for secular threat)"
        likelihood: medium
        implications:
          - "Shifts enforcement onto the Church’s moral machinery"
          - "Creates a future vulnerability if clergy turn hostile"
        dependencies:
          - "Which priests have access to the household and how cooperative they are"

      - option: "Counter-rumor offensive (‘enemies will say anything’) paired with selective intimidation"
        likelihood: low
        implications:
          - "Makes the topic speakable only as slander, not inquiry"
          - "Harder to sustain if evidence ever emerges"
        dependencies:
          - "Availability of scapegoats/enemies to blame"

    priority: high
    needs_decision_by: "Before any play or canon thread treats the household as either ‘tight-lipped’ or ‘leaky’ in 1030"
    notes: "This choice determines whether the Breach becomes a quiet administrative maneuver or the start of visible repression."

          The Christ fed five thousand with five loaves.
          He did not ask if they had paid their tithe.
          He did not record their debt.
          He broke bread and gave it freely.
          This is the true tithe—to God’s poor, not princes’ barns.
          Blessed are they who hunger for righteousness.
        why_it_works:
          - "Orthodox surface (biblical charity framing) masks the inversion"
          - "Memetic design (short, repeatable, emotionally apt during hunger)"
