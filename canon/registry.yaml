    biography:
      summary: |
        Oswald is defined by an insistence that political reality is not negotiated but imposed. In moments
        where evidence could fracture authority, he refuses argument and instead abolishes the category of
        permissible doubt. His governance style treats rumor, speculation, and “maybe” as actionable threats.

        In spring 1030, when Brother Adalmar warns that Leopold’s birth creates a legitimacy vulnerability,
        Oswald’s response—“There will be no talk.”—exemplifies his core method: not refutation, but social
        criminalization of the premise. For Oswald, legitimacy is an enforced condition that must remain
        absolute to keep oaths, charters, and succession from becoming provisional.
      key_traits:
        - "Sovereign certainty (asserts reality rather than arguing it)"
        - "Low tolerance for ambiguity; treats doubt as subversion"
        - "Strategic about legitimacy and institutional leverage"
        - "Capable of pragmatic alliance when it serves power"
      motivations:
        - "Preserve the unbroken legitimacy of his house and heirs"
        - "Prevent Church leverage and rival-lord narratives from reopening civil war"
        - "Make future governance instruments (oaths/charters) feel final"
      contradictions:
        - "Requires institutions (Church, scribes, oaths) while fearing their leverage"
        - "Benefits from revolutionary infrastructure while policing destabilizing speech"

    biography:
      summary: |
        Adalmar operates where administration becomes power: household schedules, travel chatter, ledger-timings,
        and the “small certainties” that accumulate around births, absences, and proximity. He understands that
        rumor is not born from ideology but from patterns people can point to.

        From fall 1024 through spring 1030 he serves as Oswald’s household chaplain, a position that grants him
        intimate access without formal political authority. In spring 1030 he approaches Oswald with a risk report
        rather than accusation, explicitly declining to name Sibilla as culprit and treating the danger as narrative
        vulnerability: “There will be talk… enemies will weaponize it… here are the weak points.” After this breach,
        his relationship with Oswald collapses into silence: they remain in the same political world, but not in
        conversation.
      key_traits:
        - "Attentive to timing and pattern (administrative intelligence)"
        - "Cautious phrasing; frames threats as management problems"
        - "Understands how narratives become weapons"
        - "Able to compartmentalize what is said vs. what is known"
      motivations:
        - "Preserve household stability (or his place within it)"
        - "Prevent enemies from gaining leverage through rumor"
        - "Maintain access and usefulness without becoming scapegoat"
      contradictions:
        - "Serves legitimacy while personally accumulating knowledge that undermines it"
        - "Warns against rumor while inevitably becoming a source of dangerous awareness"

    biography:
      summary: |
        Sibilla is a political organizer whose authority is grounded in communal practice and disciplined
        consent structures. As Keeper of the Moot, she represents governance that is legible to peasants
        and threatening to orthodox hierarchies.

        In spring 1030 she becomes an axis around which others might try to form a scandal, but Adalmar’s
        approach to Oswald explicitly avoids accusing her. Oswald’s response—abolishing the premise of talk—
        functions as a public shield, whatever Sibilla’s private awareness or involvement may be.
      key_traits:
        - "Organizational authority rooted in communal practice"
        - "Disciplined, strategic, and politically literate"
        - "Understands leverage and narrative control"
        - "Capable of maintaining public unity under pressure"
      motivations:
        - "Preserve and expand the Moot’s practical power"
        - "Protect her community and its autonomy"
        - "Prevent outside institutions from converting scandal into domination"

        Otto is the regime’s legitimacy anchor in miniature: too young for agency, but central to how the
        household experiences threat. Because succession is a story people must believe before it becomes a
        fact they obey, Otto’s line cannot be allowed to feel provisional.

        The Breach (spring 1030) functions partly as Otto-protection: by abolishing “maybe illegitimate” as a
        permissible category, Oswald prevents adjacent doubt from splashing onto Otto’s future oaths and charters.

      summary: |
        A working parish priest whose authority is sacramental and social rather than political. In spring 1029,
        he becomes the unintended moral hinge of the Walpurghausen Incident: peasants confess receiving grain that
        ‘must have been stolen,’ and they repeat a sermon that sounds charitable while undermining tithe legitimacy.
        
        Ruodprecht does not reach for heresy charges. He chooses a compromise—penance, partial restitution where
        possible, and careful language—because naming the thing risks turning hunger into open defiance.

    biography:
      summary: |
        An abbey man who sees the world in charters, obligations, and precedent. During spring 1029 he is occupied
        with renewal negotiations and a dispute mediation involving Konrad and the Graf’s reeve. When the tithe wagon
        arrives light, Anshelm presses for investigation and restitution, using the incident to argue that secular power
        cannot be trusted to protect church property.
        
        He focuses on grain and jurisdiction; the sermon’s theological inversion reads to him as peasants repeating
        pious-sounding nonsense rather than a deliberate weapon.
      key_traits:
        - "Legal-minded"
        - "Institutionally loyal"
        - "Confrontational in negotiation"
        - "Blind to memetic/folk mechanics"
      motivations:
        - "Protect abbey property and precedents"
        - "Win leverage in charter renewal"
        - "Shift blame onto secular road security"
      contradictions:
        - "Invokes charity as church virtue while prioritizing restitution and authority optics"

      - char_konrad:
          type: adversarial

      summary: |
        A professional watcher of roads and stories. When the Walpurghausen tithe wagon arrives light, Hasso does not
        accept the neat ‘bandits’ framing; the restraint-only handling and the timing suggest planning. His value is not
        in brilliance but in discipline: he follows the contradictions, notes what is missing (blood, panic, looting),
        and reports that the matter needs careful handling.
        
        He is privately relieved that no one died. That relief is practical: blood makes martyrs, martyrs make movements.

        - "Keep order without provoking revolt"

      summary: |
        Gerhild is the kind of person power relies on: she can count, she can write, and she refuses to let losses vanish
        into story. Her tally triggers the entire response chain. Yet she also sees what the paper cannot deny: hunger has
        a look, and the villages look less hungry after the missing grain.
        
        This makes her dangerous to both sides. To authorities, because she will not let matters be waved away; to rebels,
        because she watches patterns and remembers.

    biography:
      summary: |
        Konrad is the hinge between competing powers: abbey claims, Graf roads, reeve authority, and the reality that a hungry
        spring makes every obligation brittle. In the Walpurghausen Incident he does what such men do: arrests that show motion,
        documentation that shows diligence, and reports that commit him to a manageable frame (“banditry”) rather than an explosive one
        (“organized tenant action with theological payload”).
        
        He likely suspects the deeper truth. He also understands that proving it would obligate responses that neither side truly wants:
        mass punishment, escalating defiance, or open humiliation of authority.
      key_traits:
        - "Politically cautious"
        - "Paper-trail minded"

        - "Protect his office and avoid blame"
        - "Keep conflict legible to superiors (crime, not revolt)"
        - "Prevent jurisdictional chaos from becoming personal ruin"
      contradictions:
