    biography:
      summary: |
        Oswald is defined by an insistence that political reality is not negotiated but imposed. In moments
        where evidence could fracture authority, he refuses argument and instead abolishes the category of
        permissible doubt. His governance style treats rumor, speculation, and “maybe” as actionable threats.

        In spring 1030, when Brother Adalmar warns that Leopold’s birth creates a legitimacy vulnerability,
        Oswald’s response—“There will be no talk.”—exemplifies his core method: not refutation, but social
        criminalization of the premise. For Oswald, legitimacy is an enforced condition that must remain
        absolute to keep oaths, charters, and succession from becoming provisional.
      key_traits:
        - "Sovereign certainty (asserts reality rather than arguing it)"
        - "Low tolerance for ambiguity; treats doubt as subversion"
        - "Strategic about legitimacy and institutional leverage"
        - "Capable of pragmatic alliance when it serves power"
      motivations:
        - "Preserve the unbroken legitimacy of his house and heirs"
        - "Prevent Church leverage and rival-lord narratives from reopening civil war"
        - "Make future governance instruments (oaths/charters) feel final"
      contradictions:
        - "Requires institutions (Church, scribes, oaths) while fearing their leverage"
        - "Benefits from revolutionary infrastructure while policing destabilizing speech"

    biography:
      summary: |
        Adalmar operates where administration becomes power: household schedules, travel chatter, ledger-timings,
        and the “small certainties” that accumulate around births, absences, and proximity. He understands that
        rumor is not born from ideology but from patterns people can point to.

        From fall 1024 through spring 1030 he serves as Oswald’s household chaplain, a position that grants him
        intimate access without formal political authority. In spring 1030 he approaches Oswald with a risk report
        rather than accusation, explicitly declining to name Sibilla as culprit and treating the danger as narrative
        vulnerability: “There will be talk… enemies will weaponize it… here are the weak points.” After this breach,
        his relationship with Oswald collapses into silence: they remain in the same political world, but not in
        conversation.
      key_traits:
        - "Attentive to timing and pattern (administrative intelligence)"
        - "Cautious phrasing; frames threats as management problems"
        - "Understands how narratives become weapons"
        - "Able to compartmentalize what is said vs. what is known"
      motivations:
        - "Preserve household stability (or his place within it)"
        - "Prevent enemies from gaining leverage through rumor"
        - "Maintain access and usefulness without becoming scapegoat"
      contradictions:
        - "Serves legitimacy while personally accumulating knowledge that undermines it"
        - "Warns against rumor while inevitably becoming a source of dangerous awareness"

    biography:
      summary: |
        Sibilla is a political organizer whose authority is grounded in communal practice and disciplined
        consent structures. As Keeper of the Moot, she represents governance that is legible to peasants
        and threatening to orthodox hierarchies.

        In spring 1030 she becomes an axis around which others might try to form a scandal, but Adalmar’s
        approach to Oswald explicitly avoids accusing her. Oswald’s response—abolishing the premise of talk—
        functions as a public shield, whatever Sibilla’s private awareness or involvement may be.
      key_traits:
        - "Organizational authority rooted in communal practice"
        - "Disciplined, strategic, and politically literate"
        - "Understands leverage and narrative control"
        - "Capable of maintaining public unity under pressure"
      motivations:
        - "Preserve and expand the Moot’s practical power"
        - "Protect her community and its autonomy"
        - "Prevent outside institutions from converting scandal into domination"

        Otto is the regime’s legitimacy anchor in miniature: too young for agency, but central to how the
        household experiences threat. Because succession is a story people must believe before it becomes a
        fact they obey, Otto’s line cannot be allowed to feel provisional.

        The Breach (spring 1030) functions partly as Otto-protection: by abolishing “maybe illegitimate” as a
        permissible category, Oswald prevents adjacent doubt from splashing onto Otto’s future oaths and charters.
