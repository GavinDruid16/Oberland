    summary:
      public: |
        Father Arnulf, now officially on penitential pilgrimage, spends the winter in Wiesenwang as a quiet,
        unremarkable priest seeking shelter and alms.
      actual: |
        Wiesenwang provides cover for survival and for the first practical scaffolding of 2DC: a few disciplined
        contacts, slow routing habits, and methods designed to outlive the founder’s direct oversight.
      hidden: |
        No public proof links Arnulf to any organized network during this winter. The operational reality is
        intentionally low-signature: counsel, small favors, and temperament screening.

    participants:
      - char_arnulf:
          role: "Exiled priest embedding in a new community"
          outcome: "Survives winter; begins 2DC pattern development"
          knowledge: "Designs networks to resist decapitation"

    organizations:
      - org_second_devils_circle:
          role: "Incipient network pattern (not visible as an organization)"
          outcome: "Begins as method rather than hierarchy"

    consequences:
      immediate:
        - "Arnulf becomes geographically harder for Oswald to seize"
      long_term:
        - "Creates the first survivable 2DC routing habits"
      unintended:
        - "Local rumors may later retroactively connect him to unrelated disorders"
