    summary:
      public: |
        Rumors of Devil’s Circle spread beyond Tiefenbrunn: not proof, but patterned gossip about odd fast-days,
        inverted sayings, and suspicious communal stores. Oswald requests (or accepts) a clerical visitation and
        begins public acts of orthodoxy: chapel repair, endowments, proper burials. Tiefenbrunn complies outwardly:
        Mass attendance spikes and confession becomes performative.
      actual: |
        Oswald manages two audiences: he must appear orthodox enough to avoid ecclesiastical escalation while
        preventing a valley-wide witch hunt that would destabilize his rule. Tiefenbrunn adapts by moving its
        real cohesion into domestic camouflage and daylight-normal behaviors.
      hidden: |
        Devil’s Circle practices are intentionally laundered into “charity” and “emergency stores” to remain
        survivable under scrutiny. Specific internal rites remain unknown to outsiders.
