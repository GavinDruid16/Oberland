    summary:
      public: |
        Sibilla becomes the visible face of a survivable Devil’s Circle: publicly orthodox, administratively competent,
        and politically useful. Oswald responds by narrowing her power through appointments, travel restrictions, and
        household curation while praising her publicly; this posture is not permanent.
      actual: |
        Oswald’s restriction is a short-lived control reflex: he cannot justify holding his own consort hostage indefinitely
        without harming legitimacy. He curates her influence rather than openly confronting it.
      hidden: |
        Sibilla continues to operate through soft-power channels (household placements, marriages, obligation webs) even when
        formal motion is constrained.
