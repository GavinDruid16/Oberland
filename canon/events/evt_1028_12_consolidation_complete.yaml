    summary:
      public: |
        By year’s end, the revolt is no longer the present tense of politics—it becomes the founding myth of Oswald’s reign.
        Tiefenbrunn remains quietly revolutionary but deniable. Rudolf remains a frontier wild-card but useful. Eberhard
        remains alive but contained.
      actual: |
        The regime has shifted from crisis management to normal governance. The core threats are now long-tail:
        ideological persistence (1DC/2DC), externalized outlaw spaces, and the possibility of future clerical escalation.
      hidden: |
        The setting’s tension persists beneath routine: sanitized survivability in Tiefenbrunn, decentralized resistance
        forming beyond Oswald’s reach, and a sealed relic in clerical custody whose story can still be weaponized.
