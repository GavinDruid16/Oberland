    summary:
      public: |
        A radical cell commits an incendiary act intended to ignite a wider rising: arson at a tithe barn, an ambush of a priest,
        or a public inversion rite. The act fails quickly and is used to justify local crackdowns, while Oswald refuses to allow a
        valley-wide witch hunt.
      actual: |
        The perpetrators are a purist 1DC branch acting in ideological consistency with Arnulf’s original theology. The action is
        doctrinally coherent but strategically catastrophic: it hands Oswald justification to clean house while maintaining the
        banditry/disorder framing.
      hidden: |
        Publicly, responsibility is blurred to avoid implicating the broader commune. Privately, the schism hardens: Sibilla’s 1DC
        tightens into survivable sanitization, while Arnulf’s 2DC formalizes anti-spectacle discipline and decentralization.
