    summary:
      public: |
        Visiting clergy and their agents press for action: rooting out heresy cannot be postponed indefinitely.
        Oswald responds with selective arrests of mid-level organizers framed as banditry, oath-breaking, or disorder
        rather than heresy.
      actual: |
        Oswald refuses to let the conflict become a valley-wide doctrinal hunt. By framing enforcement as crime, he
        satisfies pressure while keeping the scope local and administrable.
      hidden: |
        Arrest selections are shaped by intelligence: targets are those who can be removed without implicating the wider
        village fabric. The goal is decapitation without martyr-making.
