      region: "Falkenau; clerical custody at Kunigunde’s convent"

    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald transfers Eberhard from castle custody to clerical custody at the reconstituted Convent of Saints
        Walburga and Emmerich under Abbess Kunigunde. Officially it is for contemplation and health: mercy and
        piety. Guards appear as servants.
      actual: |
        Functionally, Eberhard is moved from visible political space to a vault. The convent provides moral
        cover and controlled access, reducing the chance that Eberhard serves as a rally point or a rescue target
        within the castle’s daily imagination. The choice is deeply ironic: the convent was funded by Eberhard in
        1013, and Kunigunde’s long forced silence now becomes custody over the man who imposed it.
      hidden: |
        Kunigunde’s custody is cathartic but rule-bound: she denies Eberhard the ability to turn the convent into
        propaganda. Oswald benefits from her strictness without needing to pressure the convent.
