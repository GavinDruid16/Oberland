    summary:
      public: |
        Father Arnulf continues his penitential pilgrimage and relocates from Wiesenwang to Krähenburg as the
        season turns, seeking work, shelter, and religious hospitality.
      actual: |
        Krähenburg’s social tolerance and traffic make it a better hub for distributed networking. The move
        supports the growth of 2DC as a routing pattern that can outlive direct leadership.
      hidden: |
        Recruitment remains low-signature: counsel, confession, favors, and temperament screening rather than
        overt organizing.

    participants:
      - char_arnulf:
          role: "Exiled priest shifting to a freer hub"
          outcome: "Expands 2DC reach and survivability"
          knowledge: "Treats hubs as routing nodes, not bases"

    organizations:
      - org_second_devils_circle:
          role: "Distributed network pattern"
          outcome: "Gains reach through a more connected locale"

    consequences:
      immediate:
        - "Arnulf becomes harder to track through Falkenau-centered intelligence nets"
      long_term:
        - "Krähenburg becomes a plausible external staging/relay point for 2DC"
      unintended:
        - "Local disputes in Krähenburg may later be blamed on 'foreign heresy'"
