    summary:
      public: |
        A public celebration of Otto’s health becomes a political event: the new rule is not a transient usurpation,
        but a dynasty beginning.
      actual: |
        The event converts private survival into public legitimacy. It invites gifts and attendance that double as
        a loyalty audit and a normalization ritual.
      hidden: |
        Attendance, gifts, and absences are quietly recorded and interpreted as signals of factional alignment.
