    summary:
      public: |
        Reports of strange court customs, missing livestock, and theft framed as tribute reach the lowlands.
        Oswald declares Rudolf’s domain a frontier ban: not fully lawful, not fully outlaw—an administrable warning
        and a denial of responsibility.
      actual: |
        The frontier ban is a governance compromise: it tells valley folk where not to go, legitimizes selective retaliation,
        and preserves Oswald’s deniability for whatever happens beyond the boundary.
      hidden: |
        In practice, enforcement remains irregular and mediated through rumor, intermediaries, and occasional punitive displays.
