      region: "Oswald’s court and household"

    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald draws key surviving Eberhard-men into his household as wards and pages. The policy is framed as
        mercy and reconciliation, but functions as control and surveillance.
      actual: |
        The policy removes future leadership from rival networks and makes remaining loyalists cautious.
        It also allows Oswald to cultivate a new administrative class loyal to him by habit and opportunity.
      hidden: |
        Some placements are chosen to isolate specific families from one another and prevent the formation of
        an alternative “old guard” within the castle.
