    summary:
      public: |
        Markets normalize. Banditry is pushed outward toward Rudolf’s hills and border regions. Oswald installs a durable
        administrative pattern: reeves answer to him directly, courts run on predictable days, and tolls are standardized.
      actual: |
        Normalization is deliberate: predictable procedures reduce the emotional oxygen for revolt. Standardized tolls and
        court rhythms shift grievances from political crises to administrable complaints.
      hidden: |
        Administrative normalization also tightens surveillance: predictable court days and reeve hierarchies create regular
        reporting flows that can be mined for dissent.
