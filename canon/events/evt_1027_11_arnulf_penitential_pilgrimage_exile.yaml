    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald moves against Father Arnulf indirectly by arranging a forced penitential pilgrimage under escort.
        Rather than a public trial, Arnulf is allowed to “vanish” into penance, which functions as exile.
        The stated purpose is correction without scandal.
      actual: |
        Oswald avoids a public heresy proceeding that would force the Church into a hard choice and drag
        Tiefenbrunn’s peasantry into direct questioning. Exile removes a dangerous organizer while reducing
        martyr potential and keeping the conflict local.
      hidden: |
        The exile has a strategic side effect: once Arnulf is outside Oswald’s territory, future action against
        him becomes politically and practically harder. Oswald accepts this cost for immediate stability.
