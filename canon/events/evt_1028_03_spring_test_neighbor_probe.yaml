    summary:
      public: |
        Neighboring Hochmark’s men probe disputes over tolls, grazing rights, forest use, and fugitives.
        Oswald responds with letters and a show of force rather than launching a new campaign.
      actual: |
        Oswald chooses low-cost deterrence to signal governability: he must demonstrate the revolt did not
        leave Falkenau weak, while avoiding another war that would re-militarize the valley.
      hidden: |
        Border probes also become a pretext to tighten control over roads and messaging under the guise of
        “security,” indirectly affecting outlaw and heresy investigations.
