    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald convenes a compensation court to record burnt barns, stolen cattle, and wartime seizures.
        Restitution is promised primarily in grain rather than coin. He begins quiet demobilization to
        prevent summer arms from becoming autumn banditry. Sibilla publicly presses for a liberation-style
        settlement for Tiefenbrunn: rent relief, fixed dues, and written rights.
      actual: |
        The court is both restitution and intelligence work: a census of grievance, allegiance, and capacity.
        Grain restitution is chosen because it is visible, controllable, and can be distributed in ways that
        build compliance. Demobilization is paced to avoid creating a free-floating armed labor market.
      hidden: |
        Some claims are quietly prioritized or delayed to reward cooperation and starve hostile networks of
        resources. The pattern is suspected but not fully documented.
