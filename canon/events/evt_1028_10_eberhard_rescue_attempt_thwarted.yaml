    summary:
      public: |
        Loyalists attempt to retrieve Eberhard from clerical custody. The attempt fails quickly; Eberhard is recaptured
        or never leaves the abbey grounds. Custody becomes stricter: fewer visitors and tighter correspondence.
      actual: |
        The failed attempt marks the end of Eberhard-as-bait and the beginning of Eberhard-as-sealed-relic. Oswald gains
        a clean justification to tighten the vault without appearing cruel.
      hidden: |
        Kunigunde enforces strict custody to prevent the convent becoming an engine for rumor or martyrdom. The event also
        helps Oswald identify remaining loyalist threads.
