    summary:
      public: |
        Rudolf and Lene die Listige withdraw with followers, framing it as a self-made court in the high country.
        Oswald does not stop them but draws a line: no raiding the valley and no taking tolls. In exchange, he
        tacitly allows them to “keep the wilds quiet,” creating a deniable frontier arrangement.
      actual: |
        Oswald chooses containment over pursuit: a known outlaw domain is less dangerous than desperate raiders
        distributed throughout the valley. Rudolf and Lene accept limits because a stable frontier increases
        their autonomy and reduces direct confrontation.
      hidden: |
        The enforcement of “no tolls, no raids” is uneven and often mediated through rumor, intermediaries,
        and selective retaliation rather than open campaigns.
