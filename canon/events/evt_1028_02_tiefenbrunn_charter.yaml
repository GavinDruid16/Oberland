    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald grants a written Tiefenbrunn Charter: fixed dues, limits on arbitrary levies, and protections for
        common stores. It is framed as Oswald’s generosity. Albrecht remains the public lord, but the settlement
        is sealed under Oswald’s authority.
      actual: |
        The charter legalizes the minimum necessary to make relapse into open revolt irrational while preserving
        the appearance of traditional lordship through Albrecht’s continued figurehead role.
      hidden: |
        The charter also provides cover for existing mutual-aid systems by giving them lawful language and limits,
        reducing what can be labeled suspicious or “heretical” in practice.
