      region: "Falkenau valley and its administrative choke points"

    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald proclaims a peace settlement and orders a realm oath-swearing among the castle household,
        market men, bridge-keepers, millers, and reeves. Keys and captains are replaced at Rotbach Bridge,
        granaries, and outer gatehouses. A limited amnesty pardons most of Eberhard’s footmen while excluding
        ringleaders; private vengeance killings are explicitly outlawed. Eberhard remains under comfortable
        guard, allowed books, hawking, and a small household.
      actual: |
        The settlement is designed to make every surviving faction legible. The oaths, key replacements,
        and amnesty function as a sorting mechanism: those willing to re-enter the system do so publicly,
        while holdouts reveal themselves by hesitation, absence, or coded defiance. Eberhard’s comfort is
        also instrumental—proof of restraint that discourages martyr narratives while flushing loyalist
        networks into view.
      hidden: |
        No confirmed hidden layer beyond routine surveillance and deliberate narrative control. Some observers
        suspect select “pardons” were granted to keep informants close, but specific names remain unconfirmed.

    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald convenes a compensation court to record burnt barns, stolen cattle, and wartime seizures.
        Restitution is promised primarily in grain rather than coin. He begins quiet demobilization to
        prevent summer arms from becoming autumn banditry. Sibilla publicly presses for a liberation-style
        settlement for Tiefenbrunn: rent relief, fixed dues, and written rights.
      actual: |
        The court is both restitution and intelligence work: a census of grievance, allegiance, and capacity.
        Grain restitution is chosen because it is visible, controllable, and can be distributed in ways that
        build compliance. Demobilization is paced to avoid creating a free-floating armed labor market.
      hidden: |
        Some claims are quietly prioritized or delayed to reward cooperation and starve hostile networks of
        resources. The pattern is suspected but not fully documented.

    summary:
      public: |
        Rudolf and Lene die Listige withdraw with followers, framing it as a self-made court in the high country.
        Oswald does not stop them but draws a line: no raiding the valley and no taking tolls. In exchange, he
        tacitly allows them to “keep the wilds quiet,” creating a deniable frontier arrangement.
      actual: |
        Oswald chooses containment over pursuit: a known outlaw domain is less dangerous than desperate raiders
        distributed throughout the valley. Rudolf and Lene accept limits because a stable frontier increases
        their autonomy and reduces direct confrontation.
      hidden: |
        The enforcement of “no tolls, no raids” is uneven and often mediated through rumor, intermediaries,

    summary:
      public: |
        Rumors of Devil’s Circle spread beyond Tiefenbrunn: not proof, but patterned gossip about odd fast-days,
        inverted sayings, and suspicious communal stores. Oswald requests (or accepts) a clerical visitation and
        begins public acts of orthodoxy: chapel repair, endowments, proper burials. Tiefenbrunn complies outwardly:
        Mass attendance spikes and confession becomes performative.
      actual: |
        Oswald manages two audiences: he must appear orthodox enough to avoid ecclesiastical escalation while
        preventing a valley-wide witch hunt that would destabilize his rule. Tiefenbrunn adapts by moving its
        real cohesion into domestic camouflage and daylight-normal behaviors.
      hidden: |
        Devil’s Circle practices are intentionally laundered into “charity” and “emergency stores” to remain
        survivable under scrutiny. Specific internal rites remain unknown to outsiders.

        It also allows Oswald to cultivate a new administrative class loyal to him by habit and opportunity.

    summary:
      public: |
        On the first anniversary of Almut’s taking, the valley is tense. Oswald issues an edict:
        no armed gatherings at the river; funerary offerings permitted only in church-acceptable forms.
        The stated goal is public safety and proper rites.
      actual: |
        The edict prevents the river from becoming a rally point and monopolizes public ritual under
        acceptable orthodoxy. It converts potentially destabilizing folklore into administrable mourning.
      hidden: |
        Authorities monitor known river sites for gatherings and identify local agitators through who appears,

    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald moves against Father Arnulf indirectly by arranging a forced penitential pilgrimage under escort.
        Rather than a public trial, Arnulf is allowed to “vanish” into penance, which functions as exile.
        The stated purpose is correction without scandal.
      actual: |
        Oswald avoids a public heresy proceeding that would force the Church into a hard choice and drag
        Tiefenbrunn’s peasantry into direct questioning. Exile removes a dangerous organizer while reducing
        martyr potential and keeping the conflict local.
      hidden: |
        The exile has a strategic side effect: once Arnulf is outside Oswald’s territory, future action against
        him becomes politically and practically harder. Oswald accepts this cost for immediate stability.

    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald transfers Eberhard from castle custody to clerical custody at the reconstituted Convent of Saints
        Walburga and Emmerich under Abbess Kunigunde. Officially it is for contemplation and health: mercy and
        piety. Guards appear as servants.
      actual: |
        Functionally, Eberhard is moved from visible political space to a vault. The convent provides moral
        cover and controlled access, reducing the chance that Eberhard serves as a rally point or a rescue target
        within the castle’s daily imagination. The choice is deeply ironic: the convent was funded by Eberhard in
        1013, and Kunigunde’s long forced silence now becomes custody over the man who imposed it.
      hidden: |
        Kunigunde’s custody is cathartic but rule-bound: she denies Eberhard the ability to turn the convent into
        propaganda. Oswald benefits from her strictness without needing to pressure the convent.

    summary:
      public: |
        Reports of strange court customs, missing livestock, and theft framed as tribute reach the lowlands.
        Oswald declares Rudolf’s domain a frontier ban: not fully lawful, not fully outlaw—an administrable warning
        and a denial of responsibility.
      actual: |
        The frontier ban is a governance compromise: it tells valley folk where not to go, legitimizes selective retaliation,
        and preserves Oswald’s deniability for whatever happens beyond the boundary.
      hidden: |
        In practice, enforcement remains irregular and mediated through rumor, intermediaries, and occasional punitive displays.

    summary:
      public: |
        Visiting clergy and their agents press for action: rooting out heresy cannot be postponed indefinitely.
        Oswald responds with selective arrests of mid-level organizers framed as banditry, oath-breaking, or disorder
        rather than heresy.
      actual: |
        Oswald refuses to let the conflict become a valley-wide doctrinal hunt. By framing enforcement as crime, he
        satisfies pressure while keeping the scope local and administrable.
      hidden: |
        Arrest selections are shaped by intelligence: targets are those who can be removed without implicating the wider
        village fabric. The goal is decapitation without martyr-making.

    summary:
      public: |
        A radical cell commits an incendiary act intended to ignite a wider rising: arson at a tithe barn, an ambush of a priest,
        or a public inversion rite. The act fails quickly and is used to justify local crackdowns, while Oswald refuses to allow a
        valley-wide witch hunt.
      actual: |
        The perpetrators are a purist 1DC branch acting in ideological consistency with Arnulf’s original theology. The action is
        doctrinally coherent but strategically catastrophic: it hands Oswald justification to clean house while maintaining the
        banditry/disorder framing.
      hidden: |
        Publicly, responsibility is blurred to avoid implicating the broader commune. Privately, the schism hardens: Sibilla’s 1DC
        tightens into survivable sanitization, while Arnulf’s 2DC formalizes anti-spectacle discipline and decentralization.

        Oswald offers a broad absolution-and-return deal: swear, confess in a vague survivable way, and be spared.
        A few leaders “vanish” into exile or pilgrimage. Rumors claim drowning or secret executions, but no bodies appear.
      actual: |
        The deal is designed to create a compliance cascade and end mass participation without producing martyrs. Ambiguity
        about vanished leaders is intentional deterrence: fear without a single grievance focal point.
      hidden: |
        Sibilla’s survival machine helps translate the deal into behavior that protects the wider community, while purists and

    summary:
      public: |
        By year’s end, the revolt is no longer the present tense of politics—it becomes the founding myth of Oswald’s reign.
        Tiefenbrunn remains quietly revolutionary but deniable. Rudolf remains a frontier wild-card but useful. Eberhard
        remains alive but contained.
      actual: |
        The regime has shifted from crisis management to normal governance. The core threats are now long-tail:
        ideological persistence (1DC/2DC), externalized outlaw spaces, and the possibility of future clerical escalation.
      hidden: |
        The setting’s tension persists beneath routine: sanitized survivability in Tiefenbrunn, decentralized resistance
        forming beyond Oswald’s reach, and a sealed relic in clerical custody whose story can still be weaponized.
