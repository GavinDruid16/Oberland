    summary:
      public: |
        On the first anniversary of Almut’s taking, the valley is tense. Oswald issues an edict:
        no armed gatherings at the river; funerary offerings permitted only in church-acceptable forms.
        The stated goal is public safety and proper rites.
      actual: |
        The edict prevents the river from becoming a rally point and monopolizes public ritual under
        acceptable orthodoxy. It converts potentially destabilizing folklore into administrable mourning.
      hidden: |
        Authorities monitor known river sites for gatherings and identify local agitators through who appears,
        who speaks, and who refuses the acceptable forms.
