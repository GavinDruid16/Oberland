    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald offers a broad absolution-and-return deal: swear, confess in a vague survivable way, and be spared.
        A few leaders “vanish” into exile or pilgrimage. Rumors claim drowning or secret executions, but no bodies appear.
      actual: |
        The deal is designed to create a compliance cascade and end mass participation without producing martyrs. Ambiguity
        about vanished leaders is intentional deterrence: fear without a single grievance focal point.
      hidden: |
        Sibilla’s survival machine helps translate the deal into behavior that protects the wider community, while purists and
        externalized networks interpret it as domestication and betrayal.
