    summary:
      public: |
        Oswald proclaims a peace settlement and orders a realm oath-swearing among the castle household,
        market men, bridge-keepers, millers, and reeves. Keys and captains are replaced at Rotbach Bridge,
        granaries, and outer gatehouses. A limited amnesty pardons most of Eberhard’s footmen while excluding
        ringleaders; private vengeance killings are explicitly outlawed. Eberhard remains under comfortable
        guard, allowed books, hawking, and a small household.
      actual: |
        The settlement is designed to make every surviving faction legible. The oaths, key replacements,
        and amnesty function as a sorting mechanism: those willing to re-enter the system do so publicly,
        while holdouts reveal themselves by hesitation, absence, or coded defiance. Eberhard’s comfort is
        also instrumental—proof of restraint that discourages martyr narratives while flushing loyalist
        networks into view.
      hidden: |
        No confirmed hidden layer beyond routine surveillance and deliberate narrative control. Some observers
        suspect select “pardons” were granted to keep informants close, but specific names remain unconfirmed.

      - char_eberhard:
          role: "Defeated Graf kept alive as proof of restraint"
          outcome: "Remains under house arrest with controlled privileges"
          knowledge: "Recognizes his comfort is instrumental; tests the boundaries quietly"
      - char_sibilla:
          role: "Public face of stability; supports settlement framing"
          outcome: "Emerges as visible faction-operator without formal office"
          knowledge: "Understands the performative value of mercy and normalcy"

    consequences:
      immediate:
        - "Oath rolls and key replacements consolidate control at choke points"
        - "Amnesty draws many former Eberhard-men into the open"
        - "Vengeance killings are delegitimized and prosecuted as disorder"
      long_term:
        - "Creates paper trails that later justify selective purges and appointments"
        - "Eberhard’s continued life becomes a managed political asset"
      unintended:
        - "Holdouts and exiles harden into external threats rather than internal ones"
