    biography:
      summary: |
        Arnulf served publicly as the parish priest of Tiefenbrunn, but from the early 1010s onward
        he held Herr Albrecht von Tiefenbrunn at an effective checkmate: outsiders saw a lord ruling
        a village, while villagers quietly oriented their obedience around the priest who controlled
        confession, mutual aid, and the moral calendar. Albrecht remained politically necessary as a
        mask, yet privately fragile so long as Arnulf’s influence endured.

        Between 1010 and 1027 Arnulf founded and led the united Devil’s Circle (1DC, pre-schism),
        building it first as survivable infrastructure (stores, labor-rotation, burial and care duties)
        and only then as theology. From a young age, Sibilla—Albrecht’s daughter—became his pupil.
        Arnulf cultivated her intelligence deliberately, teaching methods of governance, persuasion,
        and “double speech” that could pass as piety on the surface while carrying inverted meanings
        for initiates. This apprenticeship produced a movement capable of operating in daylight.

        In November 1027 Oswald engineered Arnulf’s removal via a “penitential pilgrimage” that functioned
        as exile, avoiding a public heresy proceeding that would have forced the Church’s hand. Arnulf
        overwintered in Wiesenwang (winter 1027–1028) and relocated to Krähenburg in spring 1028, where
        he began shaping a decentralized Second Circle (2DC): small cells, minimal cross-knowledge,
        slow routing, and discipline designed to survive interrogation and selective purges.

        The Night of Ash (July 1028) was perpetrated by a purist 1DC branch whose ideology was consistent
        with Arnulf’s original theology. This sharpened the schism in practice: Sibilla’s 1DC tightened
        into sanitized survivability, while Arnulf’s 2DC embraced decentralization and long-horizon
        delegitimization rather than open revolt.
      key_traits:
        - "Charismatic teacher and recruiter"
        - "Ritual and language engineer (double meanings, survivable signals)"
        - "Strategic thinker who prefers systems over heroic gestures"
        - "Controls through care, counsel, and obligation rather than overt force"
        - "Ideologically rigorous, yet tactically patient"
      motivations:
        - "Establish consent-based legitimacy (anti-lord moral framework)"
        - "Preserve his followers by making the movement survivable under pressure"
        - "Prove theology can become governance (not merely belief)"
        - "Prevent domestication of revolt into a new, sanctified lordship"
      contradictions:
        - "Uses priestly authority to preach against illegitimate authority"
        - "Preaches consent while building dependency through mutual aid systems"
        - "Denies hierarchy while remaining the doctrinal source others orbit"
        - "Requires secrecy to survive, but secrecy produces its own power imbalances"

    relationships:
      - char_albrecht_von_tiefenbrunn:
          type: "enemy"
          nature: "Public partnership masking private domination; Arnulf keeps Albrecht as a necessary figurehead while holding him in checkmate."
          period: [1011, 1027]
          notes: "Albrecht cannot openly countermand him without risking legitimacy and control in Tiefenbrunn."

      - char_sibilla:
          type: "complicated"
          nature: "Teacher–pupil bond; he sculpted her competence and methods, later reading her 'sanitized' Circle as domestication of the revolt."
          period: [1015, 1027]
          notes: "Pupilage begins young; later political divergence becomes the defining wound."

      - char_oswald:
          type: "enemy"
          nature: "Mutual strategic respect at distance; Oswald removes him without trial to avoid martyrdom and clerical escalation."
          period: [1026, null]
          notes: "Oswald’s exile move makes Arnulf harder to target in the future."

      - char_kunigunde:
          type: "complicated"
          nature: "Institutional friction: Arnulf’s heterodoxy vs. her convent as a vault of orthodoxy and custody."
          period: [1027, null]
          notes: "No open animosity required; both operate through structures rather than spectacle."
