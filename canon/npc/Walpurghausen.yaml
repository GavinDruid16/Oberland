    biography:
      summary: |
        Luitgarde is a steady-handed servant in Walpurghausen vogtei service: the girl who trims lamp-wicks, shakes out guest-bedding,
        and runs errands between barns, hall, and shrine without drawing comment. Small, plain, and tidy, she keeps her eyes down until
        she is sure she is unobserved—then watches with an unsettling patience. Indoors, her hands are always clean, as if cleanliness
        itself were part of her cover.

        Patient and obedient on the surface, she is quietly intent beneath it. She remembers details without seeming to listen, learns
        routines until she can predict who will be where, and places herself where she can hear what matters. She never pushes for secrets;
        she waits for them to fall out. She wants responsibility beyond errands—proof she can be relied upon when the household is stressed
        or ashamed.

        Her fear is not sin but mis-speech: confession frightens her because saying the wrong thing to the wrong ear can ruin more than a soul.
        She receives occasional counsel from Arnulf “Schwarzpriester,” framed as guidance for a troubled girl. She believes he is her only true
        patron, which makes her loyalty personal rather than ideological—useful, and volatile if that bond is threatened. Three-Axis Alignment:
        Neutral / Solitude / Neutral.
      key_traits:
        - "Small, plain, tidy; practiced invisibility"
        - "Patient and quietly intent"
        - "Excellent routine memory; notices patterns"
        - "Obedient in surface; difficult to dislodge once decided"
        - "Neither cruel nor soft; necessity-driven"
      motivations:
        - "To be trusted with responsibility beyond errands"
        - "To prove reliability under stress and shame"
        - "To keep herself ‘forgettable’ while staying useful"
      contradictions:
        - "Craves trust, but fears being seen as clever"
        - "Avoids confession to prevent mis-speaking, while serving a patron who thrives on careful words"
        - "Loyal to a person more than a doctrine, yet drawn into doctrine-shaped operations"

          notes: "If she believes he is threatened or lying to her, she may act unpredictably to ‘protect’ the bond."
      - char_konrad:
          type: complicated
          nature: "Indirect employer within the vogtei; she serves the household order that supports his office while staying socially invisible."
          period: [1029, null]
          notes: "Useful as an unnoticed witness; dangerous if pressed into formal testimony."
