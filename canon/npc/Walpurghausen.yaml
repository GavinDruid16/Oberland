    biography:
      summary: |
        Luitgarde is a steady-handed servant in Walpurghausen vogtei service: the girl who trims lamp-wicks, shakes out guest-bedding,
        and runs errands between barns, hall, and shrine without drawing comment. Small, plain, and tidy, she keeps her eyes down until
        she is sure she is unobserved—then watches with an unsettling patience. Indoors, her hands are always clean, as if cleanliness
        itself were part of her cover.

        Patient and obedient on the surface, she is quietly intent beneath it. She remembers details without seeming to listen, learns
        routines until she can predict who will be where, and places herself where she can hear what matters. She never pushes for secrets;
        she waits for them to fall out. She wants responsibility beyond errands—proof she can be relied upon when the household is stressed
        or ashamed.

        Her fear is not sin but mis-speech: confession frightens her because saying the wrong thing to the wrong ear can ruin more than a soul.
        She receives occasional counsel from Arnulf “Schwarzpriester,” framed as guidance for a troubled girl. She believes he is her only true
        patron, which makes her loyalty personal rather than ideological—useful, and volatile if that bond is threatened. Three-Axis Alignment:
        Neutral / Solitude / Neutral.
      key_traits:
        - "Small, plain, tidy; practiced invisibility"
        - "Patient and quietly intent"
        - "Excellent routine memory; notices patterns"
        - "Obedient in surface; difficult to dislodge once decided"
        - "Neither cruel nor soft; necessity-driven"
      motivations:
        - "To be trusted with responsibility beyond errands"
        - "To prove reliability under stress and shame"
        - "To keep herself ‘forgettable’ while staying useful"
      contradictions:
        - "Craves trust, but fears being seen as clever"
        - "Avoids confession to prevent mis-speaking, while serving a patron who thrives on careful words"

    biography:
      summary: |
        A working parish priest whose authority is sacramental and social rather than political. In spring 1029,
        he becomes the unintended moral hinge of the Walpurghausen Incident: peasants confess receiving grain that
        ‘must have been stolen,’ and they repeat a sermon that sounds charitable while undermining tithe legitimacy.
        
        Ruodprecht does not reach for heresy charges. He chooses a compromise—penance, partial restitution where
        possible, and careful language—because naming the thing risks turning hunger into open defiance.
      key_traits:
        - "Pastoral"
        - "Conflict-avoidant under pressure"
        - "Sensitive to doctrinal inversion"
        - "Pragmatic about hunger"
      motivations:
        - "Keep his flock from spiritual and legal ruin"
        - "Prevent violence and reprisals"
        - "Preserve orthodox language while managing an unorthodox situation"
      contradictions:
        - "Defends the sacrament of confession while it becomes a shield for organized dissent"

    biography:
      summary: |
        An abbey man who sees the world in charters, obligations, and precedent. During spring 1029 he is occupied
        with renewal negotiations and a dispute mediation involving Konrad and the Graf’s reeve. When the tithe wagon
        arrives light, Anshelm presses for investigation and restitution, using the incident to argue that secular power
        cannot be trusted to protect church property.
        
        He focuses on grain and jurisdiction; the sermon’s theological inversion reads to him as peasants repeating
        pious-sounding nonsense rather than a deliberate weapon.

        A professional watcher of roads and stories. When the Walpurghausen tithe wagon arrives light, Hasso does not
        accept the neat ‘bandits’ framing; the restraint-only handling and the timing suggest planning. His value is not
        in brilliance but in discipline: he follows the contradictions, notes what is missing (blood, panic, looting),
        and reports that the matter needs careful handling.
        
        He is privately relieved that no one died. That relief is practical: blood makes martyrs, martyrs make movements.

        Gerhild is the kind of person power relies on: she can count, she can write, and she refuses to let losses vanish
        into story. Her tally triggers the entire response chain. Yet she also sees what the paper cannot deny: hunger has
        a look, and the villages look less hungry after the missing grain.
        
        This makes her dangerous to both sides. To authorities, because she will not let matters be waved away; to rebels,
        because she watches patterns and remembers.

    biography:
      summary: |
        Konrad is the hinge between competing powers: abbey claims, Graf roads, reeve authority, and the reality that a hungry
        spring makes every obligation brittle. In the Walpurghausen Incident he does what such men do: arrests that show motion,
        documentation that shows diligence, and reports that commit him to a manageable frame (“banditry”) rather than an explosive one
        (“organized tenant action with theological payload”).
        
        He likely suspects the deeper truth. He also understands that proving it would obligate responses that neither side truly wants:
        mass punishment, escalating defiance, or open humiliation of authority.
