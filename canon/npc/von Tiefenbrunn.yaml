    biography:
      summary: |
        Sibilla is a political organizer whose authority is grounded in communal practice and disciplined
        consent structures. As Keeper of the Moot, she represents governance that is legible to peasants
        and threatening to orthodox hierarchies.

        In spring 1030 she becomes an axis around which others might try to form a scandal, but Adalmar’s
        approach to Oswald explicitly avoids accusing her. Oswald’s response—abolishing the premise of talk—
        functions as a public shield, whatever Sibilla’s private awareness or involvement may be.
      key_traits:
        - "Organizational authority rooted in communal practice"
        - "Disciplined, strategic, and politically literate"
        - "Understands leverage and narrative control"
        - "Capable of maintaining public unity under pressure"
      motivations:
        - "Preserve and expand the Moot’s practical power"
        - "Protect her community and its autonomy"
        - "Prevent outside institutions from converting scandal into domination"
      contradictions:
        - "Exercises real authority while living inside institutions that deny it (lordship, Church)"
        - "Needs stability for governance while aligned with doctrines that legitimize refusal"
