    biography:
      summary: |
        Adalmar operates where administration becomes power: household schedules, travel chatter, ledger-timings,
        and the “small certainties” that accumulate around births, absences, and proximity. He understands that
        rumor is not born from ideology but from patterns people can point to.

        From fall 1024 through spring 1030 he serves as Oswald’s household chaplain, a position that grants him
        intimate access without formal political authority. In spring 1030 he approaches Oswald with a risk report
        rather than accusation, explicitly declining to name Sibilla as culprit and treating the danger as narrative
        vulnerability: “There will be talk… enemies will weaponize it… here are the weak points.” After this breach,
        his relationship with Oswald collapses into silence: they remain in the same political world, but not in
        conversation.
      key_traits:
        - "Attentive to timing and pattern (administrative intelligence)"
        - "Cautious phrasing; frames threats as management problems"
        - "Understands how narratives become weapons"
        - "Able to compartmentalize what is said vs. what is known"
      motivations:
        - "Preserve household stability (or his place within it)"
        - "Prevent enemies from gaining leverage through rumor"
        - "Maintain access and usefulness without becoming scapegoat"
      contradictions:
        - "Serves legitimacy while personally accumulating knowledge that undermines it"
        - "Warns against rumor while inevitably becoming a source of dangerous awareness"
