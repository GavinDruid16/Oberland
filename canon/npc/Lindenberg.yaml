  biography:
    summary: |
      Graf Ulrich is a western Allgäu land-power who rules from a fortified hill-manor and prefers problems to remain small, local, and settled
      before they become someone else’s pretext. Tall and lean in his late fifties, he carries the posture of a lifetime of riding and mountain
      travel: straight-backed, controlled, never hurried. His mantle and brooch are modest by choice—dignity over display.

      Calm, judicial, and reserved, he watches before he speaks and rarely raises his voice. Among intimates, a dry humor surfaces, but warmth is
      not his currency. He is an experienced political operator used to balancing ecclesiastical pressure (Kempten, Ottobeuren) with secular
      obligations to the Landgraf, and he understands the economics of orchards, cattle-levies, and toll lines as well as he understands faces.

      He relies on disciplined reeves and sergeants for enforcement, and he avoids leading armed parties himself now—not from weakness, but from
      a deliberate preference for stable machinery over personal heroics. He suspects several valley lordships (including Falkenau) are quietly
      weakening, though he lacks proof and will not commit his dignity to rumor.
    key_traits:
      - "Calm, judicial, reserved"
      - "Values dignity above warmth"
      - "Dry humor among intimates"
      - "Patient negotiator; avoids spectacle"
      - "Sees stability as a craft, not a mood"
    motivations:
      - "Preserve stability in the western Allgäu"
      - "Maintain good relations with Kempten without being dominated"
      - "Secure a respected, untroubled inheritance for his heirs"
      - "Keep the Landgraf’s attention pleasant and distant"
    contradictions:
      - "Wants distance from conflict, yet sits close enough to arbitrate it"
      - "Dislikes rumor, yet trusts his ‘sense’ of weakening authority"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Irmengard is the house’s long-memory and silent pressure: a matriarch who dominates conversations by asking careful questions and then
      letting the silence do its work. In her early fifties, she dresses plainly but elegantly—olive wool, dark hems, and a silver-thread girdle—
      and carries the unflappable calm of someone who has watched alliances fray and learned to pull the right thread first.

      Skilled in high-born correspondence, heraldry, and ecclesiastical etiquette, she maintains letter-friend networks across Kempten, Ottobeuren,
      Kaufbeuren, and Lindau. She reads rural vassal alliances with a cold accuracy that can feel like prophecy, and she keeps a small library of
      devotional works alongside older land charters and inherited tables.

      Her private strength is a very old vellum genealogical table that references peripheral houses—including Falkenau, Lindenberg, Rohrdorf, and
      the obscure von Kimratshofen. If compared against weaponized forgeries, it could ruin a career—or topple a claim.
    key_traits:
      - "Perceptive, candid, unflappable"
      - "Uses silence as leverage"
      - "Letter-network builder"
      - "Charter-minded; remembers details"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Dietrich is the castle’s spine: barrel-chested, broad-shouldered, late forties, and built for cold service. He wears an old hauberk over
      quilted linen when duty demands and walks with the stiff gait of a man who has known too many winters on stone. He speaks little, but he
      remembers everything that matters: who was on watch, what was counted, what was missing.

      He oversees the keep’s arms, granaries, and stores, trains levy leaders in winter and spring, and plans defense with a craftsman’s eye for
      where frost eats stone. Lightly educated but numerate, he keeps the armoury tallies himself because he trusts his own hand more than any
      clerk’s cleverness.

      His one private shame is older than his office: he lost two men in a blizzard south of the pass decades ago and believes their spirits linger
      near the Silbergrat. He avoids that travel when he can, and when he cannot, he over-prepares.
    key_traits:
      - "Loyal, blunt, practical"
      - "Pride in readiness"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Sister Helena is a quiet counterweight inside Lindenberg: late thirties, plain black veil and undyed wool, ink-stained hands from copying
      homilies. Serious and contemplative, she speaks softly but precisely, and she does not bend moral language to comfort powerful ears.

      She advises the Graf on canon law and church relations, maintains a small scriptorium for devotional copying, and hears confessions from
      household retainers who fear their own tongues more than their sins. Her influence is not theatrical; it is persistent.

      She has received a troubling letter from a priest in Hohenegg about “the quieting of bells in troubled nights,” and she has not yet shown it
      to the Graf—part caution, part fear that naming a thing gives it weight.
    key_traits:

  biography:
    summary: |
      Otto is the house’s future weight: early twenties, wiry and athletic, earnest in public and impulsive in private. He reads and writes better
      than many nobles of his age and has a good singing voice that makes him feel older than he is. He wants to be worthy of inheritance and
      dreams of proving himself on campaign or in arbitration.

      He romanticizes frontier danger and treats rumor as invitation. That hunger for significance makes him easy to steer—by flatterers, by older
      officers who want a symbol, or by anyone who frames a risk as a chance for honorable action.

      Privately, he keeps a journal of ambitions far grander than his station and fears disappointing his father. His greatest vulnerability is
      that he wants to be seen as decisive before he knows what decisiveness costs.

  biography:
    summary: |
      Lady Bertrade is the household’s internal law: mid-forties, stern, immaculate, and always carrying keys on a braided cord. She supervises

      Efficient and commanding, she protects the house’s dignity the way a castellan protects stone—by noticing stress fractures early. She keeps
      a near-photographic memory for who said what, when, and which visitors left debts or caused embarrassment.

      She could ruin reputations if she chose. The fact that she usually does not is why she is trusted.

  biography:
    summary: |
      Conrad Holzmann is rural governance made human: weathered, lean, and in his fifties, with tally-sticks and account pouches that seem to
      weigh nothing in his hands. He inspects orchards and vineyards personally, handles disputes between peasants with practiced gruffness, and
      measures success in harvest stability and lack of flight.

      He is trustworthy rather than warm, and he prefers facts to speeches. When roads feel unsafe, he does not moralize; he assigns watchers and
      reroutes carts.

      He is quietly pressured by a minor noble from [NEW NAMES FOR REVIEW] Steingaden to divert a portion of vineyard tithe; he has refused so far,
      knowing that one small bend in the books can become a permanent hinge for blackmail.
    key_traits:
      - "Practical, experienced, sometimes gruff"
      - "Detail-oriented with tallies"
      - "Road-safety minded"
      - "Resists petty corruption (so far)"
    motivations:
      - "Stability of harvests and rents"
      - "Prevent peasant flight"
      - "Keep roads safe for drovers and peddlers"
    contradictions:
      - "Must squeeze tenants for survival while trying not to break them"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Sir Albrecht is a veteran made cautious: broad-shouldered, scarred, mid-forties, wearing worn but well-repaired mail and keeping his helmet
      strapped at the saddle when traveling. He leads escorts on dangerous roads and reads terrain like a ledger—where an ambush would sit, where a
      retreat can breathe, where winter turns bravery into stupidity.

      Stoic and bluntly honest, he prefers discipline over glory and avoids unnecessary bloodshed. He suffers sleeplessness when winter winds howl
      across the ridge, a reminder of old losses he refuses to dress up as heroism.

      He is the sort of man Otto will imitate if Otto learns anything real.
    key_traits:
      - "Stoic, dutiful, bluntly honest"
      - "Terrain-reader; ambush-minded"
      - "Discipline-first; avoids needless blood"

    motivations:
      - "Protect the Graf’s family"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Gerwin is thin as a willow and very tall, smelling of hay and leather, quick-footed despite his gangly frame. Cheerful and plain-spoken, he
      loves horses more than people and reads temperament at a glance with the confidence of a man who has kept too many mounts alive through thin
      winters.

      He manages breeding, feeding, and training, keeps meticulous breeding notes, and diagnoses minor ailments before they become stable-wide
      problems. He is superstitious in a rural way: he believes one ridge above the Silbergrat is unlucky for beasts and avoids grazing there.

      He dismisses wyvern rumors as lammergeier talk—until a horse refuses a trail it has never refused before.

  biography:

      Marlene is young (early twenties), slender, and carefully muted in dress, with hands folded when not occupied. She rarely speaks without
      purpose and has a practiced ability to drift at the edges of important conversations without appearing to listen.

      Skilled in needlework and court etiquette, she carries messages discreetly within the household and outward through Irmengard’s channels. She
      memorizes faces, voices, and small details with ease, and she can reproduce a scene’s social geometry later without seeming remarkable.

      She is loyal to Irmengard and privately ambitious: she wants to marry into minor nobility and knows that being trusted with delicate errands is
      the first rung. She once overheard a tense conversation between the Graf and Prior Matthias in which Falkenau was mentioned; she has told no one.
    key_traits:
      - "Attentive, observant, polite"
      - "Speaks only with purpose"
      - "Uncanny edge-of-room presence"
