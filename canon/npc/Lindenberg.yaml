  biography:
    summary: |
      Graf Ulrich is a western Allgäu land-power who rules from a fortified hill-manor and prefers problems to remain small, local, and settled
      before they become someone else’s pretext. Tall and lean in his late fifties, he carries the posture of a lifetime of riding and mountain
      travel: straight-backed, controlled, never hurried. His mantle and brooch are modest by choice—dignity over display.

      Calm, judicial, and reserved, he watches before he speaks and rarely raises his voice. Among intimates, a dry humor surfaces, but warmth is
      not his currency. He is an experienced political operator used to balancing ecclesiastical pressure (Kempten, Ottobeuren) with secular
      obligations to the Landgraf, and he understands the economics of orchards, cattle-levies, and toll lines as well as he understands faces.

      He relies on disciplined reeves and sergeants for enforcement, and he avoids leading armed parties himself now—not from weakness, but from
      a deliberate preference for stable machinery over personal heroics. He suspects several valley lordships (including Falkenau) are quietly
      weakening, though he lacks proof and will not commit his dignity to rumor.
    key_traits:
      - "Calm, judicial, reserved"
      - "Values dignity above warmth"
      - "Dry humor among intimates"
      - "Patient negotiator; avoids spectacle"
      - "Sees stability as a craft, not a mood"
    motivations:
      - "Preserve stability in the western Allgäu"
      - "Maintain good relations with Kempten without being dominated"
      - "Secure a respected, untroubled inheritance for his heirs"
      - "Keep the Landgraf’s attention pleasant and distant"
    contradictions:
      - "Wants distance from conflict, yet sits close enough to arbitrate it"
      - "Dislikes rumor, yet trusts his ‘sense’ of weakening authority"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Irmengard is the house’s long-memory and silent pressure: a matriarch who dominates conversations by asking careful questions and then
      letting the silence do its work. In her early fifties, she dresses plainly but elegantly—olive wool, dark hems, and a silver-thread girdle—
      and carries the unflappable calm of someone who has watched alliances fray and learned to pull the right thread first.

      Skilled in high-born correspondence, heraldry, and ecclesiastical etiquette, she maintains letter-friend networks across Kempten, Ottobeuren,
      Kaufbeuren, and Lindau. She reads rural vassal alliances with a cold accuracy that can feel like prophecy, and she keeps a small library of
      devotional works alongside older land charters and inherited tables.

      Her private strength is a very old vellum genealogical table that references peripheral houses—including Falkenau, Lindenberg, Rohrdorf, and
      the obscure von Kimratshofen. If compared against weaponized forgeries, it could ruin a career—or topple a claim.
    key_traits:
      - "Perceptive, candid, unflappable"
      - "Uses silence as leverage"
      - "Letter-network builder"
      - "Charter-minded; remembers details"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Dietrich is the castle’s spine: barrel-chested, broad-shouldered, late forties, and built for cold service. He wears an old hauberk over
      quilted linen when duty demands and walks with the stiff gait of a man who has known too many winters on stone. He speaks little, but he
      remembers everything that matters: who was on watch, what was counted, what was missing.

      He oversees the keep’s arms, granaries, and stores, trains levy leaders in winter and spring, and plans defense with a craftsman’s eye for
      where frost eats stone. Lightly educated but numerate, he keeps the armoury tallies himself because he trusts his own hand more than any
      clerk’s cleverness.

      His one private shame is older than his office: he lost two men in a blizzard south of the pass decades ago and believes their spirits linger
      near the Silbergrat. He avoids that travel when he can, and when he cannot, he over-prepares.
    key_traits:
      - "Loyal, blunt, practical"
      - "Pride in readiness"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Sister Helena is a quiet counterweight inside Lindenberg: late thirties, plain black veil and undyed wool, ink-stained hands from copying
      homilies. Serious and contemplative, she speaks softly but precisely, and she does not bend moral language to comfort powerful ears.

      She advises the Graf on canon law and church relations, maintains a small scriptorium for devotional copying, and hears confessions from
      household retainers who fear their own tongues more than their sins. Her influence is not theatrical; it is persistent.

      She has received a troubling letter from a priest in Hohenegg about “the quieting of bells in troubled nights,” and she has not yet shown it
      to the Graf—part caution, part fear that naming a thing gives it weight.
    key_traits:

  biography:
    summary: |
      Otto is the house’s future weight: early twenties, wiry and athletic, earnest in public and impulsive in private. He reads and writes better
      than many nobles of his age and has a good singing voice that makes him feel older than he is. He wants to be worthy of inheritance and
      dreams of proving himself on campaign or in arbitration.

      He romanticizes frontier danger and treats rumor as invitation. That hunger for significance makes him easy to steer—by flatterers, by older
      officers who want a symbol, or by anyone who frames a risk as a chance for honorable action.

      Privately, he keeps a journal of ambitions far grander than his station and fears disappointing his father. His greatest vulnerability is
      that he wants to be seen as decisive before he knows what decisiveness costs.

  biography:
    summary: |
      Lady Bertrade is the household’s internal law: mid-forties, stern, immaculate, and always carrying keys on a braided cord. She supervises

      is natural rather than manufactured.

      Efficient and commanding, she protects the house’s dignity the way a castellan protects stone—by noticing stress fractures early. She keeps
      a near-photographic memory for who said what, when, and which visitors left debts or caused embarrassment.

  biography:
    summary: |
      Conrad Holzmann is rural governance made human: weathered, lean, and in his fifties, with tally-sticks and account pouches that seem to
      weigh nothing in his hands. He inspects orchards and vineyards personally, handles disputes between peasants with practiced gruffness, and
      measures success in harvest stability and lack of flight.

      He is trustworthy rather than warm, and he prefers facts to speeches. When roads feel unsafe, he does not moralize; he assigns watchers and
      reroutes carts.

      He is quietly pressured by a minor noble from [NEW NAMES FOR REVIEW] Steingaden to divert a portion of vineyard tithe; he has refused so far,
      knowing that one small bend in the books can become a permanent hinge for blackmail.
    key_traits:
      - "Practical, experienced, sometimes gruff"
      - "Detail-oriented with tallies"
      - "Road-safety minded"
      - "Resists petty corruption (so far)"
    motivations:
      - "Stability of harvests and rents"
      - "Prevent peasant flight"
      - "Keep roads safe for drovers and peddlers"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Sir Albrecht is a veteran made cautious: broad-shouldered, scarred, mid-forties, wearing worn but well-repaired mail and keeping his helmet
      strapped at the saddle when traveling. He leads escorts on dangerous roads and reads terrain like a ledger—where an ambush would sit, where a
      retreat can breathe, where winter turns bravery into stupidity.

      Stoic and bluntly honest, he prefers discipline over glory and avoids unnecessary bloodshed. He suffers sleeplessness when winter winds howl
      across the ridge, a reminder of old losses he refuses to dress up as heroism.

      He is the sort of man Otto will imitate if Otto learns anything real.

      Gerwin is thin as a willow and very tall, smelling of hay and leather, quick-footed despite his gangly frame. Cheerful and plain-spoken, he
      loves horses more than people and reads temperament at a glance with the confidence of a man who has kept too many mounts alive through thin
      winters.

      He manages breeding, feeding, and training, keeps meticulous breeding notes, and diagnoses minor ailments before they become stable-wide
      problems. He is superstitious in a rural way: he believes one ridge above the Silbergrat is unlucky for beasts and avoids grazing there.

      He dismisses wyvern rumors as lammergeier talk—until a horse refuses a trail it has never refused before.

      Marlene is young (early twenties), slender, and carefully muted in dress, with hands folded when not occupied. She rarely speaks without
      purpose and has a practiced ability to drift at the edges of important conversations without appearing to listen.

      Skilled in needlework and court etiquette, she carries messages discreetly within the household and outward through Irmengard’s channels. She
      memorizes faces, voices, and small details with ease, and she can reproduce a scene’s social geometry later without seeming remarkable.

      She is loyal to Irmengard and privately ambitious: she wants to marry into minor nobility and knows that being trusted with delicate errands is
      the first rung. She once overheard a tense conversation between the Graf and Prior Matthias in which Falkenau was mentioned; she has told no one.

  biography:
    summary: |
      Adelmar Holzweber is mid-fifties, thickset and stooped from decades of lifting sacks and crates, with ink-and-dust stained fingers and the
      cautious manner of a man who has watched winters punish optimism. Mild-mannered and methodical, he speaks slowly and chooses words with care.
      His harvest pessimism makes him reliable—he is rarely wrong, because he assumes the world will fail in the most common ways.

      He oversees storage, drying, fumigation, and rotation across Lindenberg’s demesne, keeping meticulous tally-sticks and parchment accounts. He
      detects spoilage early, advises the reeve on tithe handling and surplus management, and coordinates with orchard and vineyard stewards when a
      shortage threatens to turn political.

      He negotiates well with peasant elders because he understands their fear: hunger is not just pain, it is shame. A small emergency reserve
      exists under his keys, known only to the Graf and Gräfin; he treats it like a sacrament—never touched lightly.
    key_traits:
      - "Cautious, methodical, mild-mannered"
      - "Pessimistic forecaster (reliably so)"
      - "Meticulous record-keeper"

  biography:

      Brother Sibrand is thin and hollow-cheeked in his late forties, wearing undyed wool and a dark scapular, carrying a simple wooden cross.
      Quiet and reflective, he is disarmingly calm in counsel and can become severe when pressed toward excuse-making.

      He hears confessions from servants and lesser retainers, assists Sister Helena in liturgical duties, and keeps a small library of sermons and
      devotional commentary. He listens like a man weighing a soul: keen-eyed, unsettlingly attentive, and skilled at noticing the half-truth
      designed to test him.

      In youth he served briefly in Falkenau and remembers not an incident but an atmosphere—winter pressure, authority carried too tightly, and a
      thinning he could never name. He worries it has worsened and watches for signs that moral disorder is becoming spiritual disorder.

  biography:
    summary: |
      Walpurga Steinmetz is late thirties, sharp-featured and brisk, with ink-stained cuffs and hair pinned in a tight coil. Precise and quietly
      judgmental, she hates disorder and lectures when given an opening, not from cruelty but from a belief that discipline prevents disaster.

      She drafts letters and inventories for the castellan, maintains fortress repair logs and levy rosters, and remembers names, dates, and debts
      with unnerving ease. Fluent in Kirchlatein, she sometimes liaises with Kempten’s clerical scribes, and she keeps a chest of archived
      correspondence dating back two decades.

      Among those archives are letters from a now-deceased Lindenberg knight who served in the valleys, hinting at strange occurrences near
      Tiefenbrunn. She has never shared them—partly from caution, partly because she does not yet know what to do with a truth that cannot be
      filed cleanly.
    key_traits:
      - "Precise, detached, discipline-minded"
      - "Quietly judgmental"
      - "Extraordinary memory for dates and names"
      - "Treats documents as reality"
    motivations:
      - "Keep the household efficient"
      - "Protect the castellan from administrative missteps"
      - "Maintain order as a defensive weapon"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Giselbrecht is tall, wiry, and weathered, with a beard streaked red and grey and pruning tools hanging from a wide belt. Blunt, practical,
      and humorless, he speaks slowly in a thick rural accent and guards peasant livelihoods as fiercely as he guards the Graf’s interests—because
      he understands they are the same thing in a bad year.

      He oversees pruning, grafting, cider-making, and seasonal labor, and he carries influence among rural elders because he solves problems
      without theatrical cruelty. He reads soil and weather by instinct and keeps several hidden apple varieties known only to his family.

      He fears a blight creeping down from the south resembles one seen in his grandfather’s time—a “black year” tied to stories he refuses to
      repeat. He will act on it, but he will not dignify it with words.

  biography:
    summary: |
      Dame Kunza is early forties, warm but disciplined, speaking with a soft Swabian lilt and carrying a walking-stick carved with geometric
      designs. She educates the Graf’s children in reading, arithmetic, piety, history, and court customs, and she uses stories as moral tools:
      lessons that lodge in the mind because they arrive disguised as tales.

      Fluent in Kirchlatein and High German, she keeps small instructional manuscripts and several prized books copied in Kempten. She avoids
      needless conflict but is clever in argument when pressed, and her influence is slow-burn: what the heirs learn to call “right” becomes policy
      later.

      She worries about what servants overhear, especially Marlene’s proximity to political talk, and she carries a quiet doubt about the tidy
      ecclesiastical telling of Falkenau’s convent disaster. Doubt does not make her reckless; it makes her watchful.

      Berthold is broad and heavily muscled, beard thick and ash-streaked, wearing burn-scarred leather and an iron ring on his thumb. Gruff but
      fair, he values honesty and grows suspicious of outsiders until they prove reliable.

      He oversees the manor’s forge, supervises apprentices and charcoal deliveries, and negotiates with local miners for ore and bars. Trusted by
      the castellan for rapid repairs, he keeps the household functioning in ways nobles seldom notice until something breaks.

      Once, at dusk near the quarry, he saw a strange pale figure—poacher, vagrant, or something else. He said nothing, but the memory unsettles
      him, and he watches the quarry edge more carefully now.

      Ida is short, stout, and late thirties, with thick arms from lifting wet linen and a smell of lye and herbs that never quite leaves her. She
      is friendly, talkative, and gregarious, but she repeats rumors carefully—more as weather-reporting than malice. Her loyalty to Lady Bertrade is
      fierce, because Bertrade protects the servant world from noble carelessness.

      She manages washing, drying, and cloth maintenance, and she senses household tension long before nobles notice. Her real power is that people
      tell her things because they are tired and half-dressed when they do.

      She overheard a heated argument between the castellan and a visiting reeve from Rettenberg about a “cairn marker shifted without cause.” She
      does not know what it means, only that voices went tight when it was said aloud.

      Ulman is lean and sun-tanned, wearing rough leather and carrying a longbow, with a wolfish intensity that makes soft words feel unsafe. He
      speaks sparingly and respects skill above rank. He leads hunts, tracks poachers and predators, trains dogs and keeps falcons, and reads the
      forest’s health by signs most people never notice.

      He sees the woods as a ledger: migration, weather, grazing pressure, disease. When something does not fit, he becomes quiet.

      He has found unusual hoofprints in the western woods—too deep for local deer, too narrow for cattle. He keeps this to himself until he knows
      whether it is an animal, a trick, or a doorway.

  biography:
    summary: |
      Wendel is broad-shouldered and middle-aged, balding, smelling of must and damp stone, with keys always close. Jovial in manner but cautious in
      judgment, he is proud of good casks and becomes trustworthy once befriended.

      He manages wine, ale, vinegar, and preserved fruits, blends household wines from Lindenberg’s terraces, and keeps detailed stock lists. He
      negotiates with vintners and brewers and hears the sort of merchant gossip that never reaches the dais because it sounds too petty to matter.

      One cask—gifted by a merchant near [NEW NAMES FOR REVIEW] Obersee—contains something other than wine. He has avoided opening it, because once
      opened, it becomes his responsibility in a way a closed cask can pretend not to be.

      - "Jovial but cautious"
      - "Proud of craft; good judge of character"

  biography:
    summary: |
      Ragenfrid is tall and heavily built in his early forties, stern and vigilant, wearing a padded gambeson and keeping a staff within reach. He
      values clear instructions and order: polite to nobility, curt with strangers, and allergic to improvisation at the gate.

      He controls passage through the manor, inspects incoming goods and visiting parties, maintains visitor logs and lodging arrangements, and
      commands a handful of younger porters. He hears notices from Kempten about bandits and smugglers and trusts paper more than stories—until a
      face makes him uneasy.

      Recently he turned away a pilgrim who claimed to have fled something “unseen” on the Pilgrim’s Path. He regrets it, but he fears speaking of
      it, because admitting fear at the gate feels like inviting the thing in.
    key_traits:
      - "Stern, orderly, vigilant"
      - "Paper-and-procedure minded"
      - "Polite upward, curt outward"
      - "Feels responsibility as weight"
    motivations:
      - "Maintain order and prevent intrusion"
      - "Preserve the Graf’s safety"
      - "Keep messenger and visitor management reliable"
    contradictions:
      - "Procedure-first, yet haunted by one choice that felt wrong even if correct"
