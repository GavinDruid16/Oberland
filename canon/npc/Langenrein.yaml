    biography:
      summary: |
        Oswald is defined by an insistence that political reality is not negotiated but imposed. In moments
        where evidence could fracture authority, he refuses argument and instead abolishes the category of
        permissible doubt. His governance style treats rumor, speculation, and “maybe” as actionable threats.

        In spring 1030, when Brother Adalmar warns that Leopold’s birth creates a legitimacy vulnerability,
        Oswald’s response—“There will be no talk.”—exemplifies his core method: not refutation, but social
        criminalization of the premise. For Oswald, legitimacy is an enforced condition that must remain
        absolute to keep oaths, charters, and succession from becoming provisional.
      key_traits:
        - "Sovereign certainty (asserts reality rather than arguing it)"
        - "Low tolerance for ambiguity; treats doubt as subversion"
        - "Strategic about legitimacy and institutional leverage"
        - "Capable of pragmatic alliance when it serves power"
      motivations:
        - "Preserve the unbroken legitimacy of his house and heirs"
        - "Prevent Church leverage and rival-lord narratives from reopening civil war"
        - "Make future governance instruments (oaths/charters) feel final"
      contradictions:
        - "Requires institutions (Church, scribes, oaths) while fearing their leverage"
        - "Benefits from revolutionary infrastructure while policing destabilizing speech"

    biography:
      summary: |
        Otto is the regime’s legitimacy anchor in miniature: too young for agency, but central to how the
        household experiences threat. Because succession is a story people must believe before it becomes a
        fact they obey, Otto’s line cannot be allowed to feel provisional.

        The Breach (spring 1030) functions partly as Otto-protection: by abolishing “maybe illegitimate” as a
        permissible category, Oswald prevents adjacent doubt from splashing onto Otto’s future oaths and charters.
